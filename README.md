My repo of Julia code for [Avent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/).

*Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.*

I am using Julia to brush up on my skills with the language. I'm a big fan of the language so far and I think it has a lot of potential to displace Python/R and C++ in the insurance industry, where the former is used for scripting and data science and the latter is used for heavy modelling.

The code in this repo is structured like a Julia package rather than a collection of simple scripts (I'm using the project guidelines in https://viralinstruction.com/posts/aoc2021_1/ as a source of 'best practice'), mainly for me to get some practice using the wider Julia ecosystem (e.g. packages, tests, benchmarking).
